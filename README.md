# Boat navigation system prototype

# Description

*Boat navigation system prototype* is a module developed in Unity (version 2020.1.13f1) for the "Finish Your Game" Jam organized by PIGSquad, that implements a boat buoyancy and control system mixing physics and shader-based functionality. This module is [downloadable as a Unity package here] (https://github.com/danigfedev/FinishYourGameJam/releases/tag/v1.0), and was conceived to be used as part of bigger projects in the future.

The idea of exploring this approach to boat navigation was born during the development of my previous project [Remote Island Cleaning Services] (https://github.com/danigfedev/CleanSailingGame).
